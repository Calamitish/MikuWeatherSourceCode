#MIKU WEATHER

## Description

"Miku Weather" was originally an Android weather forecast application installed on Sony Xperia A SO-04E feat. HATSUNE MIKU devices. The support of the original service was terminated back in 2016. The images such as icons are the resources recycled from the terminated original application. Illustrated by [eruri](https://vocadb.net/Ar/3344)

This application requires Google Maps API access and GPS location permission. Weather forecast data is fetched from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) using RetroFit packages.
